I've known a number of people who have done time capsules for 1st birthdays. I haven't contributed b/c I haven't been intimately involved with the child and it seems that a lot of contributed things are kinda weird or historical and not really about the child and his/her life. Anyway, we keep a "treasure box" for our son. I figure eventually it'll be a HUGE cedar box full of items important to him, us, his growing up-- not just photos or baby clothes, but also first favorite toys (once discarded) and letters written to him by others and important tokens of our own adult lives. And I don't think we'll keep it away from him until a particular age. He already loves for us to tell him stories about himself and we use our photos and other objects to make these stories concrete.
